# JSON Support
Currently a JSON representation is not part of the MTConnect Standard. Until an official format is decided on, this project supports the formats below:

## JSON (MTConnect.NET Flavor)
This is the flavor of JSON that was originally supported by MTConnect.NET libraries and applications.

## JSON-CPPAGENT
This is the flavor of JSON supported by the MTConnect C++ Reference Agent.

## Notes (12/12/2023)
Hopefully a standardized flavor will be agreed on and this project will support the new format.
